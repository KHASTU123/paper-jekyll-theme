### 01. Hello World in Python

~~~python
print("Hello, World!")
a = 2
b= 3
print(a*b)
print("Phan Van kha")
~~~

This is the most basic Python command. It prints a string to the console.

### 02. Variables and Data Types in Python

~~~python
My full name = "Phan Van Kha"
I am 21 years old and I really like intersting moment.


print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old.")
~~~

In this example:
- `name` is a string
- `age` is an integer
- `is_student` is a boolean

We also use **f-string formatting** to print variables inside a string.
